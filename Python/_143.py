"""
Given a matrix of size n x m, reverse the order of its columns in-place so that the last column becomes the first, the second-last becomes the second, and so on.

Examples:

Input: n = 4, m = 3, matrix[][] = [[1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7], [11, 10, 9], [13, 14, 15]]
Output: [[3, 2, 1], [7, 6, 5], [9, 10, 11], [15, 14, 13]]
Explanation: Array after exchanging columns:
              [[3, 2, 1],
               [7, 6, 5],
               [9, 10, 11],
               [15, 14, 13]]
Input: n = 2, m = 5, matrix[][] = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]
Output: [[5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [10, 9, 8, 7, 6]]
Explanation: After reversing the column of matrix
                [[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
                 [10, 9, 8, 7, 6]]
Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100
0 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 1000
