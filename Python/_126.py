"""
Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a  pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a pattern.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output:
1
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output:
1
1 2 
1 2 3 
Your Task:

You don't need to input anything. Complete the function printTriangle() which takes an integer n  as the input parameter and prints the pattern.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n2).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1<= n <= 100
