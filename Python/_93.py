"""
Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, return the merged array in ascending order containing unique elements.

Examples:

Input: arr1[] = [11, 1, 8], arr2[] = [10, 11]
Output: [1, 8, 10, 11]
Explanation: The ouput array after merging both the arrays and removing duplicates is [1 8, 10, 11]
Input: arr1[] = [7, 1, 5, 3, 9], arr2[]  = [8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr1.size(), arr2.size() ≤ 104
1 ≤ arr1[i], arr2[i] ≤ 109
