Given a number n, determine whether it is a prime number or not.
Note: A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Examples :

Input: n = 7
Output: true
Explanation: 7 has exactly two divisors: 1 and 7, making it a prime number.
Input: n = 25
Output: false
Explanation: 25 has more than two divisors: 1, 5, and 25, so it is not a prime number.
Input: n = 1
Output: false
Explanation: 1 has only one divisor (1 itself), which is not sufficient for it to be considered prime.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 109

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
