Given a positive integer n, find the square root of n. If n is not a perfect square, then return the floor value.

Floor value of any number is the greatest Integer which is less than or equal to that number

Examples:

Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.
Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: Since, 11 is not a perfect square, floor of square root of 11 is 3.
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 3*104

class Solution:
    def floorSqrt(self, n): 
        return int(n**0.5)
