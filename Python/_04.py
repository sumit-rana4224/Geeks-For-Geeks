"""
You are given a number n. The number n can be negative or positive. If n is negative, print numbers from n to 0 by adding 1 to n in the neg function. If positive, print numbers from n-1 to 0 by subtracting 1 from n in the pos function.

Note:- You don't have to return anything, you just have to print the array.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 0
Output:
already Zero
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
Output:
3 2 1 0
Example 3:

Input:
n = -3
Output:
-3 -2 -1 0
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to take input of test cases. Just complete the functions pos() and neg().

Constraints:
-103 <= x <= 103
