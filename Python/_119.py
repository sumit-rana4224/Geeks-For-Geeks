"""
Given a positive integer N, write a function to find if it is a power of three or not.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
31 is a power of 3.
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
No
Explanation:
5 is not a power of 3.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPowerof3() which takes an integer N and returns "Yes" if N is a power of 3, else "No" if N is not a power of 3.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1<=N<=(32-bit largest integer)
