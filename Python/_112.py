"""
Given an array Arr[] of N integers.Find the sum of values of even and odd index positions separately.

Example 1:

Input:
N=5
Arr={1,2,3,4,5}
Output:
9 6
Explanation:
The sum of elements at odd places i.e
at 1st,3rd and 5th places are (1+3+5=9)
Similarly,the sum of elements at even 
places i.e. at 2nd and 4th places are
(2+4=6).
Example 2:

Input:
N=5
Arr={1,1,1,1,1}
Output:
3 2
Explanation:
The sum of elements at odd places
is (1+1+1=3).Similarly, the sum of
elements at even places is (1+1=2)

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your Task is to complete the function EvenOddSum() which takes an integer N and an array Arr as input parameters and returns the sum of elements in odd places and in even places separately.
 

Expected Time Complexity:O(N)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Constraints:
1<=N<=105
0<=Arr[i]<=104,for 0<=i
