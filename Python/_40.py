Given an array arr[] of positive integers. The task is to return the count of the number of odd and even elements in the array.

Note: Return two elements where the first one in the count of odd & second one is the count of even.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 3 2
Explanation: There are 3 odd elements (1, 3, 5) and 2 even elements (2 and 4).
Input: arr[] = [1, 1]
Output: 2 0
Explanation: There are 2 odd elements (1, 1) and no even elements.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size <= 106
1 <= arr[i] <= 106
